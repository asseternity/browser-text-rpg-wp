// side quests minigame

// initialize:
// during exploration, after a certain point, add a button to teleport to your God's pocket dimension
// there is a store there to buy equipment (LOTS OF CHOICES!)
// there is also a deva to talk to, who has a list of sidequests 
// (all of which are to kill a specific monster (random monster form the monsters array))

// randomly generate an exploration terrain with random monsters
// the lines will be generated like 'it's a ${monsters.monster.name}! It's a fight!' 
// designate one monster as sideQuestTarget
// if you kill that, the exploration ends, and you return to the board
