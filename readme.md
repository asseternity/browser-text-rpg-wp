# LORE.
## THE WORLD 
— The world is neutral. There are 20 suns around the planet. 20 PHOENIXES, flying around the planet every day, sleeping at night. Each PHOENIX is a God representing a CONCEPT that might drive a living creature. The planet is an EXPERIMENT over which concept actually drives creatures.
— Gods exist, but do not affect the world in any way. They are concepts. After death, all living creatures REINCARNATE. If the creature has promoted a God’s concept really amazingly, they reincarnate into mythical beings — SPIRITS, with magical powers to help promote the cause further. If they stray from the concept path, they die and reincarnate again. 
— Creatures that did not promote a concept (most humans and almost all animals) reincarnate this way: humans into animals and animals into humans. Each reincarnation, the new creature takes certain physical characteristics and personality traits from their last life: a dying human reincarnates into an animal they most resembled personality wise in life; and a newborn human will appear to have mannerisms of their last animal life.
— Over time, if a soul stays consistent to their PRINCIPLES (even if they are not recognized as a CONCEPT or if they did not do enough to turn into a SPIRIT), that soul’s bodies’ looks get more and more reinforced within a certain personality and animal / looks. A person with a lion’s personality turns into a lion, which then, when dead, creates a human with a PREDISPOSITION into an even more lion’s personality, creating a LOOP over many generations.
— This creates HOUSES OF SPIRIT ANIMALS. RANDOS, with no clear PREDISPOSITION, are considered second rate people. The clearer the PREDISPOSITION, the more that soul was sticking to its PRINCIPLES over many lifetimes.
— No magic besides the abilities of SPIRITS.

## THE FATED REALM
### History
Union of city states that is also a religious authority, headed by the HIGHFATE. The five good concepts are known as the FATED WAY and good citizens are supposed to follow all five, “living by FATED WAY”. The line of HIGHFATES actually do this to muddy the impact of people to any single concept and prevent them from becoming SPIRITS. PROTECTOR wants to tame the lands for humans, create order without giving up control to mythical beings.

### Technology
Victorian. Muskets. Strong religion. Height of imperialism. Col. Sanders Mustaches. Phoenixes are small suns with vague wings around them.

## THE DEAD LANDS
The Dead Lands, as they are called in the Fated Realm, are the opposite. They channel the power of the mythical beings. They work with good Spirits and fight evil Spirits. They make bodies for good Spirits to inhabit using the deceased person's bones, called ARUAKHS. ARUAKHS resemble undead, and require special place / event to communicate with, so outsiders just call these people 'The Dead Lands' / 'Deadlanders', even though they are a lot of different CLANS, each following a specific SUN / PHOENIX. 

**The Dead Land Clans are specificity and embracing the supernatural, as a contrast to the Fated Realm.**

## THE NEW DAWN EDICT
Proclaimed by the Fated Realm's HIGHFATE. Members of the adventurers' guild must go to the Dead Lands to destroy the 'center where the dead are rumored to appear'. In the Edict, this place is called the Necropolis. In reality, it's the biggest toihana or something where the Deadlanders speak to Aruakhs. 

**Enemies:**
**(1) WISPS - Outside of an artificial body (whereby the Spirit becomes an ARUAKH), Spirits resemble wisps, and can only affect other Spirits.** 
**(2) SKELETONS - Artificial bodies made by the Deadland Clans for Spirits to inhabit. Different variations, also made for animals.**

## THE ADVENTURERS / THE CHOSEN ONES
**These Adventurers are members of the Adventurer's Guild. They jobs is to go to towns or wilderness and solve problems. They are Victorian vibes Witchers!**

### Captain Petunia "Peculiar" Quirke - OVERCONTROLLING / HYPERVIGILANT
Female with olive skin in her early 40's. Duncan from Dragon Age personality. Captain. Older sister of Char 2. Smokes often. Believes herself to be caring and **self-sacrificial**, but deep down is bitter, grumpy and tired of this shit.

### Snapdragon "Snap" Quirke - RUNNING AWAY, SEARCHING FOR HAPPINESS AS A FAR AWAY PLACE
Male with long hair and olive skin in his early 30's. Male. Reyes from MEA personality. Think himself charming but is **constantly moving to run away from responsibilities or chores** of the mundane life. Wants to move from party to party to not have to feel or deal with literal and metaphorical messes.

### Lysander MacAppleby - TAKING EVERYTHING AS AN ORDER
Nonbinary with shoulder length red hair and scars in their mid 30's. Jane Shepard personality. Soldier to the bone, **thinks about what they need to do 24/7**. Remembers everything anyone tells them. Loyal without question. Is really into retaining respect of their career-oriented peers in the Fated Realm, **in a capitalist way**.
